# chrome_dino_genetic_bot

Very basic genetic algorithm bot using only Pillow, pyautogui, time and numpy

The project builds on the script suggested in:

and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jwd69MRYwg

Then added a very basic genetic algorithm inspired by:

To do:
- Rigorous testing.
- Improve state generation method.
- Improve policy rules. Suggest using ml techniques.
- Create new and more complex crossover and mutations.

Version History:
- Raw - First try
- v0 - Hard coded, fixed state inheritance for new generations
- v1 - Removed hard coding.
